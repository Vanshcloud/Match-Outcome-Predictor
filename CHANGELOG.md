# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

One entry per milestone. An entry says what changed and, where the choice was
not obvious, why — a changelog that only lists filenames is a `git log` with
extra steps.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-03

Milestone 2: ingestion.

### Added

- Provider-adapter layer (`src/ingestion/`). 39 competitions across 27
  countries and two provider file layouts reduce to one canonical 35-column
  schema; a full ingest yields 305,499 matches over 1993-2026. CI enforces that no module outside `src/ingestion` names the
  provider, so adding a source cannot leak into downstream code.
- Competition registry (`configs/leagues.yaml`). Adding a league is a config
  entry; `league_filter` splits country files that mix a league with a cup
  (Argentina) or two tiers (Switzerland).
- Season-label normalisation covering both split (`2024-25`) and calendar
  (`2024`) seasons, read per row — Japan's J1 League switches between them.
- Robust CSV reading: `utf-8-sig`/`cp1252` fallback, BOM handling, blank-row
  and ragged-row repair, and an HTML-served-as-CSV guard.
- Canonical team identity scoped to country (`eng:man-united`), stable across
  promotion and relegation, with a rename detector.
- Checksum manifests (`src/ingestion/manifest.py`) as dataset versioning.
- `scripts/fetch_data.py`, `make data`, `make leagues`, `make test-int`.
- `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` — thirteen measured provider quirks, each naming the
  file it was found in.
- 16 integration tests asserting football-shaped invariants on real data
  (home-win rate, half-time ≤ full-time, shots on target ≤ shots, odds implying
  an overround above 100%). All skip without downloaded data.

### Changed

- Ragged-row handling now warns instead of raising. The original rule — surplus
  non-empty means a shifted row — was falsified by Italian Serie B 2003/04,
  whose 42-column header has eight blank names and whose 49-field rows are
  correctly aligned. Raising also aborted the entire run on one bad file out of
  roughly seven hundred.
- `PathsConfig.sample_dir` removed. No data slice is committed: the provider
  publishes no redistribution licence, and the unit suite is already offline.
- Every config section is now optional, since every field within one has a
  default.

### Notes

- No fuzzy team-name matching, and that was a measurement: 51 distinct team
  strings across 34 Premier League seasons, with the two most similar distinct
  pairs at exactly 0.800 similarity. Any threshold that catches a rename merges
  Sheffield United with Sheffield Wednesday.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-03

Milestone 1: repository foundation.

### Added

- Typed, frozen configuration (`src/utils/config.py`): YAML defaults overlaid
  by an explicit map of environment variables, validated by Pydantic v2.
  Unknown keys are an error rather than being silently ignored.
- Project-root-anchored path resolution (`src/utils/paths.py`), so no module
  computes a location relative to its own file.
- Idempotent logging setup (`src/utils/logging.py`) writing to stderr.
- A polite retrying HTTP client (`src/utils/http.py`) with atomic downloads:
  a truncated file is deleted rather than left to be parsed as a short season.
- Quality gates: ruff, black, mypy (strict), pytest. 71 tests, 100% coverage
  of `src`.
- `commit-msg` authorship hook, installed via version-controlled
  `core.hooksPath` so it survives a reclone.
- GitHub Actions CI running the same gates a developer runs locally.

### Notes

- `requirements.txt` grows one milestone at a time. A pinned dependency that
  nothing imports is a supply-chain surface with no upside.
- Pydantic does not run field validators on defaults unless
  `validate_default=True`. Without it, `data_dir` resolved to an absolute path
  when named in the config and a relative one when omitted — every downstream
  path would then have depended on the process's working directory. Fixed at
  the base model so no future section can reintroduce it.
